 **Blackjack Game: A Simple JavaScript Implementation**

This is a simple JavaScript program that simulates a game of blackjack. The program starts by dealing two cards to the player, and then prompts the player to draw a new card or stay. If the player's total card value is less than 21, they can choose to draw a new card. If the player's total card value is 21, they have blackjack and win the game. If the player's total card value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.

**Code Walkthrough**

The program begins by defining two variables, `firstCard` and `secondCard`, which represent the values of the first and second cards dealt to the player. The program then calculates the sum of the two cards and stores the result in the variable `sum`.

```javascript
let firstCard = 6;
let secondCard = 9;

let sum = firstCard + secondCard;
```

The program then uses an `if` statement to check the value of `sum`. If `sum` is less than 21, the program prints the message "Do you want to draw a new card?" to the console. This prompts the player to decide whether to draw a new card or stay.

```javascript
if (sum < 21) {
  console.log("Do you want to draw a new card?");
}
```

If `sum` is equal to 21, the program prints the message "Wohoo! You have got Blackjack!" to the console. This indicates that the player has won the game.

```javascript
else if (sum === 21) {
  console.log("Wohoo! You have got Blackjack!");
}
```

If `sum` exceeds 21, the program prints the message "Bust! You lose." to the console. This indicates that the player has lost the game.

```javascript
else {
  console.log("Bust! You lose.");
}
```

**Conclusion**

This simple JavaScript program provides a basic implementation of a blackjack game. The program simulates the dealing of two cards to the player, and then prompts the player to draw a new card or stay. The program also checks the player's total card value and determines whether the player has won or lost the game.
